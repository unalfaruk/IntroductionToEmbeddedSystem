# Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments

#### Assesment - 2

This repo contains .c and .h files and Makefile for the assesment 2.

I couldn't manage to complete this task because I haven'te experienced it and I didn't listen to the lessons on coursera :) So, I looked at other repositories to understand, then I copied this task from [pacurtin] because his/her repo is really perfect!
