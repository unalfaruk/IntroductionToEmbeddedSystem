# Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments

#### Assesment - 3

This repo contains source and output files and Makefile for the assesment 3.

At this time, I managed to complete this task because I have read and analyse the Makefile of Assesmen 2 carefully, then I write gcc(arm) command manually before for testing and created Makefile, besides that when I got an error, I looked at [pacurtin] repo because his/her repo is really perfect!
